        <p>I'll say this. I have a lot of hobby. Too much that if I have to list it down it'll take way too long. Well, at least that's what I thought. So instead I'll tell you some of my top favorites of hobbies that I spend alot of time doing.<br> This is my TOP 4 HOBBIES I HAVE</p>

          <h2>Reading Comics, Manga & Manhua</h2>
          <p>You know what is comic right? But what's Manga? What's Manhua? Well to tell you they're all the same thing but different origin's. The word <b>Comic</b> is the norm word and pronunciation used by people dare I say, not have much knowledge about comic books. But to true readers like me. When we say the title of the comic book, we tend or commonly link the origin's of that particular book. We have unspeakable rules for it. <b>Coimc</b> is the term to state that it is of <i>English</i> origin. <b>Manga</b> is from <i>Japanese</i> and the term <b>Manhua</b> is to state that it's from the <i>Chinese</i>. Right now I'm currently reading Manga<b>s</b> entitled <i>Monster Musume No Iru Nichijou</i> and <i>Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken</i>. I'm also currently reading a Manhua entitled <i>Hero? I Quit A Long Time Ago</i>. My Favorites of them all will be <i>Tokyo Ghoul, Shingeki no Kyojin, Bleach</i> and <i>Kimetsu no Yaiba.</i></p>

          <h2>Watching Anime<br></h2>
          <p>As the <b>Z Generation</b>, I've long been introduced to the existence of the internet and all the great wonders & horrors it brings. I was first introduced to the <b>Anime</b> community by my seniors in highschool. My very first anime is <b>To Love Ru</b>, as a healhty growing boy I immediately got addicted to this cuz I'm going through my puberty. Through this particular +16 rate anime I was introduced to the world of all sugar & sexy. Then I was introduced to another anime entitled <b>Akame Ga Kill</b>. Damn that one is a huge blow to me. Through this one I was thought about the meaning and importance of life, I've even avoid stepping on ants after the experiance. Then it was <b>Shingeki no Kyojin</b> and so on... . My experiance watching anime shape me to be who I am today. Since I've watched all sorts of anime(except yaoi), I became a main character of myself in my own life. While I speak less, I've noticed more than anyone, Understands more than what I let out, cuz it looks like I've know all there is to know.</p>

            <h2>My extra sense keep me up at night</h2>
            <p>Ever since little, my eyes can see things that I'm not to tell others. Travel Channel adds to its extensive catalogue of shows about ghostly occurrences with this series. It's a catch-all for what the network calls "amazing, eye-opening and downright scary" paranormal videos from around the world, all captured by eyewitnesses. In addition, a panel of knowledgeable specialists in the field breaks down the footage and analyses exactly what was filmed, and the people lucky enough to witness firsthand the strange phenomena offer their accounts. All told, it just might make a believer out of even the biggest sceptics.</p>

        <h2>Ridiculously Smart & Tragically Stupid</h2>
        <p>My name is <b>Asael Anthony</b>. Alternate nicknames includes <b>Sky Ruler</b>(GamingName), <b>Shan Er</b>(ChineseName) and <b>Sora Kami</b>(JapaneseName). This year of 2021 I'm <i>20 years old</i>. Now I'm currently studying in UiTM on Computer & Mathematical Sciences. Current status is <b>Single</b>, but not really looking for any. Given my ridiculous request for a life partner it's understandable. For a partner I'm looking for a ridiculously perfect package. Smart, Strong and agile, possesses great muscle and six pack balanced with powerful boobs of the C cup size but not more than DD since it could literarily kill me, awesomely smart, understanding, has this aura of a Goddess that can make you kneel for no reasons in her presence. Now I know why I'm single. As for future ambitions, I'm still in the blank. It's weird that I have so many to decide when I'm little but now I'm still have nothin'. Becuz I thougth for sure it's going to be zombie apocalypse or alien invasion or monster mutation in my time. But reality is ofthen disappointing, instead we get COVID and stupid quarantine. Where's the flying car that Wawasan2020 promised!!?? <br>This is me Asael tellin' you to roll with your life. </p>
